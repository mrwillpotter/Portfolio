## Advanced CSS - Portfolio
This assignment was to build the HTML and CSS code for a new webpage so that it met the acceptance criteria and ensured that everything was in working order. It can also serve as a working portfolio as future projects continue to progress my skills and development.

Working webpage URL: https://mrwillpotter.github.io/Portfolio/
